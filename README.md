🔹 Linear Regression – Salary Prediction

The first part of the notebook focuses on Linear Regression, where a model is trained to predict job salary based on years of experience.
This exercise demonstrates:

The relationship between experience and salary

Data preparation and model training

Making predictions using a regression model

Understanding how linear regression fits a line to data

🔹 Classification – Iris Flower Prediction

The second part of the notebook applies a classification model using the Iris dataset from sklearn.
The goal is to predict the type of flower based on its features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

This section demonstrates:

Loading built-in datasets from scikit-learn

Training a classification model

Predicting flower species

Evaluating model performance

🎯 Purpose of the Notebook

The main purpose of this notebook is learning and experimentation, helping build a strong foundation in:

Machine learning workflows

Regression vs classification

Model training and prediction using scikit-learn

This notebook is suitable for beginners who want hands-on practice with core machine learning concepts.
